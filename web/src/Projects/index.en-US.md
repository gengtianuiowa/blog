### [Flowmapper](https://flowmapper.org)

[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_UbZE5HgxM&t=2s), [GitHub](https://github.com/geo-social/flowmapper)

A professional web-based "flow mapping" tool developed using HTML + CSS +
Javascript. It is designed for visualizing dynamic data, such as population movements, vehicle flows, etc. Many
illustrations in the laboratory are created using this tool. The achievement has been published to Journal of Maps.

### [[OpenLayer+Servlet+PostGIS] Web GIS application of campus of Wuhan University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atWvCKkJXJQ)

[GitHub](https://github.com/gengtianuiowa/Campus-WebGIS)
<code src="../../components/Projects/CampusMapPics.tsx" inline="true"></code>
This program was
developed on around June 2018. The system included three layers structure: client (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), server (Java,
or Servlet) and database (PostGIS). Client end included login service which was connected to account database
when checking the authorities. The map data was drew on 2016, when I was a sophomore, by digitalizing remote sensing
image of informatics campus of my university with ArcGIS, and the style of map was created by QGIS and posted on the
server. In this program, all data were imported into database and called by the servlet server. Map system was based
on OpenLayer, a map Javascript Library.

### Luoyou, a Map Navigation System For The Cherry Blossom Festival of Wuhan University

[GitHub](https://github.com/gengtianuiowa/Luoyou-Campus-Navigation-App-Backend)

"Luoyou" is a Android App which was sponsored by Wuhan University, which was expected
to tackle with the increasing amount of tourists each year in "Cherry Blossom Festival" season and their difficulties in
navigation the campus. I was responsible for the backend development of this app. The backend provides route navigations
and
spatial query APIs to the Android app. APIs this backend server includes: nearest tourist attractions search,
route planning, switch of route mode (pedestrian, bus, car route), fuzzy query of point of interests. We applied Spring
MVC as the project structure.

### [Web Crawling of Baidu Street Views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPATSxE-m0U)

[GitHub](https://github.com/gengtianuiowa/Baidu-Street-View-Crawling-App)
<code src="../../components/Projects/StreetViewCrawl.tsx" inline="true"></code>

A applet written in Python referred by my undergraduate graduation study
thesis. It enables users to input URL and coordinates of the point to download the
street views directly from the Baidu Map, without any requirements of authentication or decoding.

### [ArcEngine Developent: US Map Drawing and Analysis System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLp0sba1G5Q&t=110s)

[GitHub](https://github.com/gengtianuiowa/Map-Visulization-Tool-By-ArcEngine)
<code src="../../components/Projects/ArcEnginePics.tsx" inline="true"></code>

The first version of this application was
developed
around May 2018, and optimized around Jan. 2019. The target of this application is to build a map management software
similar but stronger than ArcMap. It not only provides many typical
functions from ArcMap, such as map visualization, editing, and feature query, but also some self-designed functions,
like calculation of buffers.

### [[ESRI StoryMap] Disign Your Own University Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCyfmsWlwvw)

<code src="../../components/Projects/StoryMapPics.tsx" inline="true"></code>

This is a web GIS system
designed round May 2018. It was powered by ESRI StoryMap, which is a web-based thematic map build tool available on ESRI
official website. I built a POI (point of interest) based web campus guide for my undergraduate university, Wuhan
University.
